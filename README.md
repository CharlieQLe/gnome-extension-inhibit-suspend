# INHIBIT SUSPEND

## What is this?

A simple extension for the GNOME Desktop Environment that disables auto-suspend. 

## What versions of GNOME does INHIBIT SUSPEND support?

It only works with GNOME 43, and likely works with future GNOME versions provided that changes to the quick settings don't break this extension.

## How do I install this?

Tar packages and an extension page are not available yet. However, the source can be used by cloning this repository and running the install script like so:

```
git clone https://github.com/CharlieQLe/gnome-extension-inhibit-suspend.git
sh install.sh
```

After the installation, simply log out and log back in and it should show up in the Extensions application!
